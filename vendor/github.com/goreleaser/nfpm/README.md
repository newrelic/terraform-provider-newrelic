## Why

While [fpm][] is great, for me it is a bummer that it depends on Ruby, tar
and probably other software.

I wanted something that could be used as a binary and/or as a lib on go-software,
so I hacked this together and it works!

## Goals

* [x] be simple to use
* [x] provide packaging for the most common linux packaging systems (at very least deb and rpm)
* [x] be distributed as a single binary
* [x] reproducible results
  * [x] depend on the fewer external things as possible
  * [x] generate packages based on yaml files (maybe also json and toml?)
* [x] be possible to use it as a lib in other go projects (namely [goreleaser][] itself)
* [ ] support complex packages and power users

## Usage

The first steps are to run `nfpm init` to initialize a config file and edit
the generated file according to your needs:

![nfpm init](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/245435/36346101-f81cdcec-141e-11e8-8afc-a5eb93b7d510.png)

The next step is to run `nfpm pkg --target mypkg.deb`.
NFPM will guess which packager to use based on the target file extension.

![nfpm pkg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/245435/36346100-eaaf24c0-141e-11e8-8345-100f4d3ed02d.png)

And that's it!

## Usage as a docker image

You can run it with docker as well:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v $PWD:/tmp/pkg \
  goreleaser/nfpm pkg --config /tmp/pkg/foo.yml --target /tmp/pkg/foo.rpm
```

That's it!

## Usage as lib

You can look at the code of nfpm itself to see how to use it as a library, or, take
a look at the [nfpm pipe on GoReleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/master/internal/pipe/nfpm/nfpm.go).

> **Attention**: GoReleaser `deb` packager only compiles with go1.10+.

## Status

* both deb and rpm packaging are working but there are some missing features.

## Special thanks

Thanks to the [fpm][] authors for fpm, which inspires nfpm a lot.

## Donate

Donations are very much appreciated! You can donate/sponsor on the main
[goreleaser opencollective](https://opencollective.com/goreleaser)! It's
easy and will surely help the developers at least buy some ‚òïÔ∏è or üç∫!
