# Resource: newrelic\_infra_alert\_condition

Use this resource to create and manage Infrastructure alert conditions in New Relic.

-> **NOTE:** This is a legacy resource. The [newrelic_nrql_alert_condition](nrql_alert_condition.html) resource is preferred for configuring alerts conditions. In most cases feature parity can be achieved with a NRQL query. This condition type may be deprecated in the future.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "newrelic_alert_policy" "foo" {
  name = "foo"
}

resource "newrelic_infra_alert_condition" "high_disk_usage" {
  policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.foo.id

  name        = "High disk usage"
  description = "Warning if disk usage goes above 80% and critical alert if goes above 90%"
  type        = "infra_metric"
  event       = "StorageSample"
  select      = "diskUsedPercent"
  comparison  = "above"
  where       = "(hostname LIKE '%frontend%')"

  critical {
    duration      = 25
    value         = 90
    time_function = "all"
  }

  warning {
    duration      = 10
    value         = 80
    time_function = "all"
  }
}

resource "newrelic_infra_alert_condition" "high_db_conn_count" {
  policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.foo.id

  name        = "High database connection count"
  description = "Critical alert when the number of database connections goes above 90"
  type        = "infra_metric"
  event       = "DatastoreSample"
  select      = "provider.databaseConnections.Average"
  comparison  = "above"
  where       = "(hostname LIKE '%db%')"
  integration_provider = "RdsDbInstance"

  critical {
    duration      = 25
    value         = 90
    time_function = "all"
  }
}

resource "newrelic_infra_alert_condition" "process_not_running" {
  policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.foo.id

  name             = "Process not running (/usr/bin/ruby)"
  description      = "Critical alert when ruby isn't running"
  type             = "infra_process_running"
  comparison       = "equal"
  where            = "hostname = 'web01'"
  process_where    = "commandName = '/usr/bin/ruby'"

  critical {
    duration      = 5
    value         = 0
  }
}

resource "newrelic_infra_alert_condition" "host_not_reporting" {
  policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.foo.id

  name        = "Host not reporting"
  description = "Critical alert when the host is not reporting"
  type        = "infra_host_not_reporting"
  where       = "(hostname LIKE '%frontend%')"

  critical {
    duration = 5
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

  * `policy_id` - (Required) The ID of the alert policy where this condition should be used.
  * `name` - (Required) The Infrastructure alert condition's name.
  * `type` - (Required) The type of Infrastructure alert condition.  Valid values are  `infra_process_running`, `infra_metric`, and `infra_host_not_reporting`.
  * `event` - (Required) The metric event; for example, `SystemSample` or `StorageSample`.  Supported by the `infra_metric` condition type.
  * `select` - (Required) The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, `cpuPercent`, `diskFreePercent`, or `memoryResidentSizeBytes`.  The underlying API will automatically populate this value for Infrastructure integrations (for example `diskFreePercent`), so make sure to explicitly include this value to avoid diff issues.  Supported by the `infra_metric` condition type.
  * `comparison` - (Required) The operator used to evaluate the threshold value.  Valid values are `above`, `below`, and `equal`.  Supported by the `infra_metric` and `infra_process_running` condition types.
  * `critical` - (Required) Identifies the threshold parameters for opening a critical alert incident. See [Thresholds](#thresholds) below for details.
  * `warning` - (Optional) Identifies the threshold parameters for opening a warning alert incident. See [Thresholds](#thresholds) below for details.
  * `enabled` - (Optional) Whether the condition is turned on or off.  Valid values are `true` and `false`.  Defaults to `true`.
  * `where` - (Optional) If applicable, this identifies any Infrastructure host filters used; for example: `hostname LIKE '%cassandra%'`.
  * `process_where` - (Optional) Any filters applied to processes; for example: `commandName = 'java'`.  Required by the `infra_process_running` condition type.
  * `integration_provider` - (Optional) For alerts on integrations, use this instead of `event`.  Supported by the `infra_metric` condition type.
  * `description` - (Optional) The description of the Infrastructure alert condition.
  * `runbook_url` - (Optional) Runbook URL to display in notifications.
  * `violation_close_timer` - (Optional) Determines how much time will pass (in hours) before an incident is automatically closed. Valid values are `1 2 4 8 12 24 48 72`. Defaults to 24. If `0` is provided, default of `24` is used and will have configuration drift during the apply phase until a valid value is provided.

```
Warning: This resource will use the account ID linked to your API key. At the moment it is not possible to dynamically set the account ID.
```

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

  * `id` - The ID of the Infrastructure alert condition.
  * `created_at` - The timestamp the alert condition was created.
  * `updated_at` - The timestamp the alert condition was last updated.
  * `entity_guid` - The unique entity identifier of the condition in New Relic.

## Thresholds

The `critical` and `warning` threshold mapping supports the following arguments:

  * `duration` - (Required) Identifies the number of minutes the threshold must be passed or met for the alert to trigger. Threshold durations must be between 1 and 60 minutes (inclusive).
  * `value` - (Optional) Threshold value, computed against the `comparison` operator. Supported by `infra_metric` and `infra_process_running` alert condition types.
  * `time_function` - (Optional) Indicates if the condition needs to be sustained or to just break the threshold once; `all` or `any`. Supported by the `infra_metric` alert condition type.


## Import

Infrastructure alert conditions can be imported using a composite ID of `<policy_id>:<condition_id>`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import newrelic_infra_alert_condition.main 12345:67890
```

## Tags

Manage infra alert condition tags with `newrelic_entity_tags`. For up-to-date documentation about the tagging resource, please check [newrelic_entity_tags](entity_tags.html#example-usage)

```hcl
resource "newrelic_alert_policy" "foo" {

  policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.foo.id

  name        = "foo infra condition"
  description = "Warning if disk usage goes above 80% and critical alert if goes above 90%"
  type        = "infra_metric"
  event       = "StorageSample"
  select      = "diskUsedPercent"
  comparison  = "above"
  where       = "(hostname LIKE '%frontend%')"

  critical {
    duration      = 25

    time_function = "all"
  }

  warning {
    duration      = 10
    value         = 80
    time_function = "all"
  }
}

resource "newrelic_entity_tags" "my_condition_entity_tags" {
  guid = newrelic_infra_alert_condition.foo.entity_guid

  tag {
    key = "my-key"
    values = ["my-value", "my-other-value"]
  }

  tag {
    key = "my-key-2"
    values = ["my-value-2"]
