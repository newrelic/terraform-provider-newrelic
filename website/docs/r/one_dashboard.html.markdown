      * `from` - The value 'from' which the threshold would need to be applied.
      * `to` - The value until which the threshold would need to be applied.
      * `severity` - The severity of the threshold, which would affect the visual appearance of the threshold (such as its color) accordingly. The value of this attribute would need to be one of the following - `warning`, `severe`, `critical`, `success`, `unavailable` which correspond to the severity labels _Warning_, _Approaching critical_, _Critical_, _Good_, _Neutral_ in the dropdown that helps specify the severity of thresholds in line widgets in the UI, respectively.

    * `filter_current_dashboard`: (Optional) Use this item to filter the current dashboard.
    * `threshold` - (Optional) An attribute that helps specify multiple thresholds, each inclusive of a range of values between which the threshold would need to function, the name of the threshold and its severity. Multiple thresholds can be defined in a table widget. The `threshold` attribute requires specifying the following attributes in a nested block - 
        * `column_name` - The name of the column in the table, to which the threshold would need to be applied.
        * `from` - The value 'from' which the threshold would need to be applied.
        * `to` - The value until which the threshold would need to be applied.
        * `severity` - The severity of the threshold, which would affect the visual appearance of the threshold (such as its color) accordingly.

### Nested `nrql_query` blocks

Nested `nrql_query` blocks allow you to make one or more NRQL queries within a widget, against a specified account.

The following arguments are supported:

  * `account_id` - (Optional) The New Relic account ID to issue the query against. Defaults to the Account ID where the dashboard was created. When using an account ID you don't have permissions for the widget will be replaced with a widget showing the data is inaccessible. Terraform will not throw an error, so this widget will only be visible in the UI.
  * `query` - (Required) Valid NRQL query string. See [Writing NRQL Queries](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql) for help.

  title = "Average transaction duration and the request per minute, by application"
  row = 4
  column = 7
  width = 6
  height = 3

  nrql_query {
    account_id  = Another_Account_ID
    query       = "FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName"

## Additional Examples

### Use the New Relic CLI to convert an existing dashboard

You can use the New Relic CLI to convert an existing dashboard into HCL code for use in Terraform.

1. [Download and install the New Relic CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli#installation--upgrades)
2. [Export the dashboard you want to add to Terraform from the UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboards-charts-import-export-data/#dashboards). Copy the JSON from the UI and paste it into a `.json` file.
3. Convert the `.json` file to HCL using the CLI: `cat dashboard.json | newrelic utils terraform dashboard --label my_dashboard_resource`

If you encounter any issues converting your dashboard, [please create a ticket on the New Relic CLI Github repository](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/issues/new/choose).

### Create a two page dashboard

The example below shows how you can display data for an application from a primary account and an application from a subaccount. In order to create cross-account widgets, you must use an API key from a user with admin permissions in the primary account. Please see the [`widget` attribute documentation](#cross-account-widget-help) for more details.

```hcl
resource "newrelic_one_dashboard" "multi_page_dashboard" {
  name = "My Multi-page dashboard"

  # Only I can see this dashboard
  permissions = "private"

  page {
    name = "My Multi-page dashboard"

    widget_bar {
      title = "foo"
      row    = 1
      column = 1

      nrql_query {
        query      = "FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET name"
      }

      # Must be another dashboard GUID
      linked_entity_guids = ["abc123"]
    }
  }

  page {
    name = "Multi-query Page"

    widget_line {
      title = "Comparing throughput cross-account"
      row    = 1
      column = 1
      width  = 12
      nrql_query {
        account_id = First_Account_ID
        query      = "FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'First Account Throughput' TIMESERIES"
      }
      nrql_query {
        account_id = Second_Account_ID
        query      = "FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Second Account Throughput' TIMESERIES"
      }
      y_axis_left_zero = false
    }
  }
}
```

## Import

New Relic dashboards can be imported using their GUID, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import newrelic_one_dashboard.my_dashboard <dashboard GUID>
```
