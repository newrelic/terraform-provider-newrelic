## Additional Examples

###  Create a two page dashboard

The example below shows how you can display data for an application from a primary account and an application from a subaccount. In order to create cross-account widgets, you must use an API key from a user with admin permissions in the primary account. Please see the [`widget` attribute documentation](#cross-account-widget-help) for more details.

```hcl
resource "newrelic_one_dashboard" "multi_page_dashboard" {
  name = "My Multi-page dashboard"

  # Only I can see this dashboard
  permissions = "private"

  page {
    name = "My Multi-page dashboard"

    widget_bar {
      title = "foo"
      row    = 1
      column = 1

      nrql_query {
        query      = "FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET name"
      }

      # Must be another dashboard GUID
      linked_entity_guids = ["abc123"]
    }
  }

  page {
    name = "Multi-query Page"

    widget_line {
      title = "Comparing throughput cross-account"
      row    = 1
      column = 1
      width  = 12
      nrql_query {
        account_id = <First Account ID>
        query      = "FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'First Account Throughput' TIMESERIES"
      }
      nrql_query {
        account_id = <Second Account ID>
        query      = "FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Second Account Throughput' TIMESERIES"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Import

New Relic dashboards can be imported using their GUID, e.g.

```
$ terraform import newrelic_one_dashboard.my_dashboard <Dashboard GUID>
```
