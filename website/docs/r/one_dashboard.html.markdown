# Resource: newrelic\_one\_dashboard

-> **NOTE:** The [newrelic_one_dashboard_json](one_dashboard_json.html) resource is preferred for configuring dashboards in New Relic. This resource does not support the latest dashboard features and will receive less investment compared to [newrelic_one_dashboard_json](one_dashboard_json.html).

## Example Usage: Create a New Relic One Dashboard

```hcl
resource "newrelic_one_dashboard" "exampledash" {
  name        = "New Relic Terraform Example"
  permissions = "public_read_only"

      }
    }

    widget_bar {
      title  = "Average transaction duration, by application"
      row    = 1
      column = 7
      width  = 6
      height = 3

      nrql_query {
        account_id = 12345
        query      = "FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName"
      }

      # Must be another dashboard GUID
      linked_entity_guids = ["abc123"]
    }

    widget_bar {
      title  = "Average transaction duration, by application"
      row    = 4
      column = 1
      width  = 6
      height = 3

      text = "### Helpful Links\n\n* [New Relic One](https://one.newrelic.com)\n* [Developer Portal](https://developer.newrelic.com)"
    }
  }

  variable {
      default_values     = ["value"]
      is_multi_selection = true
      item {
        title = "item"
        value = "ITEM"
      }

### Nested `nrql_query` blocks

Nested `nrql_query` blocks allow you to make one or more NRQL queries within a widget, against a specified account.

The following arguments are supported:

  * `account_id` - (Optional) The New Relic account ID to issue the query against. Defaults to the Account ID where the dashboard was created. When using an account ID you don't have permissions for the widget will be replaced with a widget showing the data is inaccessible. Terraform will not throw an error, so this widget will only be visible in the UI.
  * `query` - (Required) Valid NRQL query string. See [Writing NRQL Queries](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql) for help.

```hcl
widget_line {
  title = "Average transaction duration and the request per minute, by application"
  row = 4
  column = 7
  width = 6
  height = 3

  nrql_query {
    account_id  = <Another Account ID>
    query       = "FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName"
  }

  nrql_query {
    query       = "FROM Transaction SELECT rate(count(*), 1 minute)"
  }
}
```

### Nested `variable` blocks

The following arguments are supported:

  * `default_values` - (Optional) A list of default values for this variable.
  * `is_multi_selection` - (Optional) Indicates whether this variable supports multiple selection or not. Only applies to variables of type `nrql` or `enum`.
  * `item` - (Optional) List of possible values for variables of type `enum`. See [Nested item blocks](#nested-item-blocks) below for details.
  * `name` - (Required) The variable identifier.
  * `nrql_query` - (Optional) Configuration for variables of type `nrql`. See [Nested nrql\_query blocks](#nested-nrql-query-blocks) for details.
  * `replacement_strategy` - (Optional) Indicates the strategy to apply when replacing a variable in a NRQL query. One of `default`, `identifier`, `number` or `string`.
  * `title` - (Optional) Human-friendly display string for this variable.
  * `type` - (Required) Specifies the data type of the variable and where its possible values may come from. One of `enum`, `nrql` or `string`

### Nested `item` blocks

The following arguments are supported:

  * `title` - (Optional) A human-friendly display string for this value.
  * `value` - (Required) A possible variable value

## Additional Examples

### Create a two page dashboard

The example below shows how you can display data for an application from a primary account and an application from a subaccount. In order to create cross-account widgets, you must use an API key from a user with admin permissions in the primary account. Please see the [`widget` attribute documentation](#cross-account-widget-help) for more details.

```hcl
resource "newrelic_one_dashboard" "multi_page_dashboard" {
  name = "My Multi-page dashboard"

  # Only I can see this dashboard
  permissions = "private"

  page {
    name = "My Multi-page dashboard"

    widget_bar {
      title = "foo"
      row    = 1
      column = 1

      nrql_query {
        query      = "FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET name"
      }

      # Must be another dashboard GUID
      linked_entity_guids = ["abc123"]
    }
  }

  page {
    name = "Multi-query Page"

    widget_line {
      title = "Comparing throughput cross-account"
      row    = 1
      column = 1
      width  = 12
      nrql_query {
        account_id = <First Account ID>
        query      = "FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'First Account Throughput' TIMESERIES"
      }
      nrql_query {
        account_id = <Second Account ID>
        query      = "FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Second Account Throughput' TIMESERIES"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Import

New Relic dashboards can be imported using their GUID, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import newrelic_one_dashboard.my_dashboard <dashboard GUID>
```

In addition you can use the [New Relic CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli#readme) to convert existing dashboards to HCL. [Copy your dashboards as JSON using the UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboards-charts-import-export-data/), save it as a file (for example `terraform.json`), and use the following command to convert it to HCL: `cat terraform.json | newrelic utils terraform dashboard --label my_dashboard_resource`.
