# Resource: newrelic\_synthetics\_script\_monitor

-> **WARNING** Support for legacy Synthetics runtimes **will reach its end-of-life (EOL) on October 22, 2024**. In addition, creating **_new_** monitors using the legacy runtime **will no longer be supported after August 26, 2024**. In light of the above, kindly **upgrade your Synthetic Monitors to the new runtime** at the earliest, if they are still using the legacy runtime. Please check out [this page](https://forum.newrelic.com/s/hubtopic/aAXPh0000001brxOAA/upcoming-endoflife-legacy-synthetics-runtimes-and-cpm) for more details on the EOL, action needed (specific to monitors using public and private locations), relevant resources, and more.

Use this resource to create update, and delete a Script API or Script Browser Synthetics Monitor in New Relic.

## Example Usage

##### Type: `SCRIPT_API`

```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor" "monitor" {
  status               = "ENABLED"
  name                 = "script_monitor"
  type                 = "SCRIPT_API"
  locations_public     = ["AP_SOUTH_1", "AP_EAST_1"]
  period               = "EVERY_6_HOURS"
  
  script               = "console.log('it works!')"
  
  script_language      = "JAVASCRIPT"
  runtime_type         = "NODE_API"
  runtime_type_version = "16.10"

  tag {
    key    = "some_key"
    values = ["some_value"]
  }
}
```
##### Type: `SCRIPT_BROWSER`

```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor" "monitor" {
  status           = "ENABLED"
  name             = "script_monitor"
  type             = "SCRIPT_BROWSER"
  locations_public = ["AP_SOUTH_1", "AP_EAST_1"]
  period           = "EVERY_HOUR"

  enable_screenshot_on_failure_and_script = false

  script = "$browser.get('https://one.newrelic.com')"

  runtime_type_version = "100"
  runtime_type         = "CHROME_BROWSER"
  script_language      = "JAVASCRIPT"

  tag {
    key    = "some_key"
    values = ["some_value"]
  }
}
```
See additional [examples](#additional-examples).

## Argument Reference

The following are the common arguments supported for `SCRIPT_API` and `SCRIPT_BROWSER` monitors:

* `account_id`- (Optional) The account in which the Synthetics monitor will be created.
* `status` - (Required) The run state of the monitor. (`ENABLED` or `DISABLED`).

-> **WARNING:** As of February 29, 2024, Synthetic Monitors no longer support the `MUTED` status. Version **3.33.0** of the New Relic Terraform Provider is released to coincide with the `MUTED` status end-of-life. Consequently, the only valid values for `status` for all types of Synthetic Monitors are mentioned above. For additional information on alternatives to the `MUTED` status of Synthetic Monitors that can be managed via Terraform, please refer to [this guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/guides/upcoming_synthetics_muted_status_eol_guide).
* `name` - (Required) The name for the monitor.
* `type` - (Required) The plaintext representing the monitor script. Valid values are SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API
* `locations_public` - (Optional) The location the monitor will run from. Check out [this page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/synthetic-public-minion-ips/) for a list of valid public locations. The `AWS_` prefix is not needed, as the provider uses NerdGraph. **At least one of either** `locations_public` **or** `location_private` **is required**.
* `location_private` - (Optional) The location the monitor will run from. See [Nested location_private blocks](#nested-location-private-blocks) below for details. **At least one of either** `locations_public` **or** `location_private` **is required**.
* `period` - (Required) The interval at which this monitor should run. Valid values are EVERY_MINUTE, EVERY_5_MINUTES, EVERY_10_MINUTES, EVERY_15_MINUTES, EVERY_30_MINUTES, EVERY_HOUR, EVERY_6_HOURS, EVERY_12_HOURS, or EVERY_DAY.
* `script` - (Required) The script that the monitor runs.
* `runtime_type` - (Optional) The runtime that the monitor will use to run jobs.
* `runtime_type_version` - (Optional) The specific version of the runtime type selected.
* `script_language` - (Optional) The programing language that should execute the script.
* `tag` - (Optional) The tags that will be associated with the monitor. See [Nested tag blocks](#nested-tag-blocks) below for details.

The `SCRIPTED_BROWSER` monitor type supports the following additional argument:

* `enable_screenshot_on_failure_and_script` - (Optional) Capture a screenshot during job execution.
* `device_orientation` - (Optional) Device emulation orientation field. Valid values are `LANDSCAPE` and `PORTRAIT`.
* `device_type` - (Optional) Device emulation type field. Valid values are `MOBILE` and `TABLET`.

#### Deprecated runtime

If you want to use a legacy runtime (Node 10 or Chrome 72) you can set the `runtime_type`, `runtime_type_version` and `script_language` to empty string `""`. 

-> **WARNING** Support for legacy Synthetics runtimes **will reach its end-of-life (EOL) on October 22, 2024**. In addition, creating **_new_** monitors using the legacy runtime **will no longer be supported after August 26, 2024**. In light of the above, kindly **upgrade your Synthetic Monitors to the new runtime** at the earliest, if they are still using the legacy runtime. Please check out [this page](https://forum.newrelic.com/s/hubtopic/aAXPh0000001brxOAA/upcoming-endoflife-legacy-synthetics-runtimes-and-cpm) for more details on the EOL, action needed (specific to monitors using public and private locations), relevant resources, and more.

### Nested `tag` blocks

All nested `tag` blocks support the following common arguments:

* `key` - (Required) Name of the tag key.
* `values` - (Required) Values associated with the tag key.

### Nested `location private` blocks

All nested `location_private` blocks support the following common arguments:

* `guid` - (Required) The unique identifier for the Synthetics private location in New Relic.
* `vse_password` - (Optional) The location's Verified Script Execution password, Only necessary if Verified Script Execution is enabled for the location.

## Additional Examples

### Create a monitor with a private location

The below example shows how you can define a private location and attach it to a monitor.

-> **NOTE:** It can take up to 10 minutes for a private location to become available.

##### Type: `SCRIPT_API`

```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_private_location" "location" {
  description               = "Example private location"
  name                      = "private_location"
  verified_script_execution = true
}

resource "newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor" "monitor" {
  status = "ENABLED"
  name   = "script_monitor"
  type   = "SCRIPT_API"
  location_private {
    guid         = newrelic_synthetics_private_location.location.id
    vse_password = "secret"
  }
  period = "EVERY_6_HOURS"

  script               = "console.log('terraform integration test updated')"
  script_language      = "JAVASCRIPT"
  runtime_type         = "NODE_API"
  runtime_type_version = "16.10"

  tag {
    key    = "some_key"
    values = ["some_value"]
  }
}
```
##### Type: `SCRIPT_BROWSER`

```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_private_location" "location" {
  description               = "Test Description"
  name                      = "private_location"
  verified_script_execution = true
}

resource "newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor" "monitor" {
  status = "ENABLED"
  name   = "script_monitor"
  type   = "SCRIPT_BROWSER"
  period = "EVERY_HOUR"
  script = "$browser.get('https://one.newrelic.com')"

  enable_screenshot_on_failure_and_script = false
  location_private {
    guid         = newrelic_synthetics_private_location.location.id
    vse_password = "secret"
  }

  runtime_type_version = "100"
  runtime_type         = "CHROME_BROWSER"
  script_language      = "JAVASCRIPT"

  tag {
    key    = "some_key"
    values = ["some_value"]
  }
}
```

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `period_in_minutes` - The interval in minutes at which Synthetic monitor should run.

## Import

Synthetics monitor scripts can be imported using the `guid`, e.g.
