# Resource: newrelic\_service\_level

Use this resource to create, update, and delete New Relic Service Level Indicators and Objectives.

A New Relic User API key is required to provision this resource.  Set the `api_key`
attribute in the `provider` block or the `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` environment
variable with your User API key.

Important:
- Only roles that provide [permissions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/) to create events to metric rules can create SLI/SLOs.
- Only [Full users](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type) can view SLI/SLOs.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "newrelic_service_level" "foo" {
    guid = "MXxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MQ"
    name = "Latency"
    description = "Proportion of requests that are served faster than a threshold."

    events {
        account_id = 12345678
        valid_events {
            from = "Transaction"
            where = "appName = 'Example application' AND (transactionType='Web')"
        }
        good_events {
            from = "Transaction"
            where = "appName = 'Example application' AND (transactionType= 'Web') AND duration < 0.1"
        }
    }

    objective {
        target = 99.00
        time_window {
            rolling {
                count = 7
                unit = "DAY"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

  * `guid` - (Required) The GUID of the entity (e.g, APM Service, Browser application, Workload, etc.) that you want to relate this SLI to. Note that changing the GUID will force a new resource.
  * `name` - (Required) A short name for the SLI that will help anyone understand what it is about.
  * `events` - (Required) The events that define the NRDB data for the SLI/SLO calculations.
  See [Events](#events) below for details.
  * `objective` - (Required) The objective of the SLI, only one can be defined.
  See [Objective](#objective) below for details.
  * `description` - (Optional) The description of the SLI.

### Events

All nested `events` blocks support the following common arguments:

  * `account_id` - (Required) The ID of the account where the entity (e.g, APM Service, Browser application, Workload, etc.) belongs to,
  and that contains the NRDB data for the SLI/SLO calculations. Note that changing the account ID will force a new resource.
  * `valid_events` - (Required) The definition of valid requests.
    * `from` - (Required) The event type where NRDB data will be fetched from.
    * `where` - (Optional) A filter that specifies all the NRDB events that are considered in this SLI (e.g, those that refer to a particular entity).
    * `select` - (Optional) The NRQL SELECT clause to aggregate events.
      * `attribute` - (Optional) The event attribute to use in the SELECT clause.
      * `function` - (Required) The function to use in the SELECT clause. Valid values are `COUNT`, `SUM`, `GET_FIELD`, and `GET_CDF_COUNT`.
      * `threshold` - (Optional) Limit for values to be counter by `GET_CDF_COUNT` function.
  * `good_events` - (Optional) The definition of good responses. If you define an SLI from valid and good events, you must leave the bad events argument empty.
    * `from` - (Required) The event type where NRDB data will be fetched from.
    * `where` - (Optional) A filter that narrows down the NRDB events just to those that are considered good responses (e.g, those that refer to
    a particular entity and were successful).
    * `select` - (Optional) The NRQL SELECT clause to aggregate events.
        * `attribute` - (Optional) The event attribute to use in the SELECT clause.
        * `function` - (Required) The function to use in the SELECT clause. Valid values are `COUNT`, `SUM`, `GET_FIELD`, and `GET_CDF_COUNT`.
        * `threshold` - (Optional) Limit for values to be counter by `GET_CDF_COUNT` function.
  * `bad_events` - (Optional) The definition of the bad responses. If you define an SLI from valid and bad events, you must leave the good events argument empty.
    * `from` - (Required) The event type where NRDB data will be fetched from.
    * `where` - (Optional) A filter that narrows down the NRDB events just to those that are considered bad responses (e.g, those that refer to
    a particular entity and returned an error).
    * `select` - (Optional) The NRQL SELECT clause to aggregate events.
        * `attribute` - (Optional) The event attribute to use in the SELECT clause.
        * `function` - (Required) The function to use in the SELECT clause. Valid values are `COUNT`, `SUM`, `GET_FIELD`, and `GET_CDF_COUNT`.
        * `threshold` - (Optional) Limit for values to be counter by `GET_CDF_COUNT` function.

### Objective

  * `target` - (Required) The target of the objective, valid values between `0` and `100`. Up to 5 decimals accepted.
  * `time_window` - (Required) Time window is the period of the objective.
    * `rolling` - (Required) Rolling window.
      * `count` - (Required) Valid values are `1`, `7` and `28`.
      * `unit` - (Required) The only supported value is `DAY`.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

  * `sli_id` - The unique entity identifier of the Service Level Indicator.
  * `sli_guid` - The unique entity identifier of the Service Level Indicator in New Relic.

## Additional Example

Service level with tags:

```hcl
resource "newrelic_service_level" "my_synthetic_monitor_service_level" {
    guid = "MXxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MQ"
    name = "My synthethic monitor - Success"
    description = "Proportion of successful synthetic checks."

    events {
        account_id = 12345678
        valid_events {
            from = "SyntheticCheck"
            where = "entityGuid = 'MXxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MQ'"
        }
        good_events {
            from = "SyntheticCheck"
            where = "entityGuid = 'MXxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MQ' AND result='SUCCESS'"
        }
    }

    objective {
        target = 99.00
        time_window {
            rolling {
                count = 7
                unit = "DAY"
            }
        }
    }
}

resource "newrelic_entity_tags" "my_synthetic_monitor_service_level_tags" {
  guid = newrelic_service_level.my_synthetic_monitor_service_level.sli_guid

   tag {
        key = "user_journey"
        values = ["authentication", "sso"]
    }

    tag {
        key = "owner"
        values = ["identityTeam"]
    }
}
```


Using `select` for events

```hcl
resource "newrelic_service_level" "my_synthetic_monitor_duration_service_level" {
  guid        = "MXxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MQ"
  name        = "Duration distribution is under 7"
  description = "Monitor created to test concurrent request from terraform"

  events {
    account_id = 313870
    valid_events {
      from = "Metric"
      select {
        attribute = "`query.wallClockTime.negative.distribution`"
        function = "GET_FIELD"
      }
      where = "metricName = 'query.wallClockTime.negative.distribution'"
    }

    good_events {
      from = "Metric"
      select {
        attribute = "`query.wallClockTime.negative.distribution`"
        function =  "GET_CDF_COUNT"
        threshold = 7
      }
      where = "metricName = 'query.wallClockTime.negative.distribution'"
    }
  }

  objective {
    target = 49
    time_window {
      rolling {
        count = 7
        unit  = "DAY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Import

New Relic Service Levels can be imported using a concatenated string of the format
 `<account_id>:<sli_id>:<guid>`, where the `guid` is the entity the SLI relates to.

Example:

```bash
$ terraform import newrelic_service_level.foo 12345678:4321:MXxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MQ
```
