While New Relic has automatically migrated your Drop Rules to Pipeline Cloud Rules upstream, <span style="color:tomato;">you must update your Terraform configuration to continue managing Drop Rules as Pipeline Cloud Rules</span>, using the <b style="color:green;">new</b> [`newrelic_pipeline_cloud_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/pipeline_cloud_rule) resource.<br><br>

-> **NOTE:** If you'd like to import a `newrelic_pipeline_cloud_rule` resource corresponding to an existing `newrelic_nrql_drop_rule` resource in your configuration in light of the aforementioned EOL, please head over to the [instructions in our Drop Rules EOL Migration Guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/guides/drop_rules_eol_guide#alternatives-and-action-needed).
