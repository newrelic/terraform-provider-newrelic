# Resource: newrelic\_nrql\_drop\_rule

-> **WARNING:** <span style="color:red;">The resource `newrelic_nrql_drop_rule` is <b>deprecated</b> and will be removed on <b>January 7, 2026</b></span>. While New Relic has automatically migrated your Drop Rules to Pipeline Cloud Rules upstream, <span style="color:tomato;">you must update your Terraform configuration to continue managing Drop Rules as Pipeline Cloud Rules</span>, using the <b style="color:green;">new</b> [`newrelic_pipeline_cloud_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/r/pipeline_cloud_rule) resource.<br><br>Please see our [migration guide](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/guides/drop_rules_eol_guide) for instructions on switching to the [`newrelic_pipeline_cloud_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/r/pipeline_cloud_rule) resource.

Use this resource to create, and delete New Relic NRQL Drop Rules.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "newrelic_nrql_drop_rule" "foo" {
  account_id  = 12345
  description = "Drops all data for MyCustomEvent that comes from the LoadGeneratingApp in the dev environment, because there is too much and we donâ€™t look at it."
  action      = "drop_data"
  nrql        = "SELECT * FROM MyCustomEvent WHERE appName='LoadGeneratingApp' AND environment='development'"
}

resource "newrelic_nrql_drop_rule" "bar" {
  account_id  = 12345
  description = "Removes the user name and email fields from MyCustomEvent"
  action      = "drop_attributes"
  nrql        = "SELECT userEmail, userName FROM MyCustomEvent"
}

resource "newrelic_nrql_drop_rule" "baz" {
  account_id  = 12345
  description = "Removes containerId from metric aggregates to reduce metric cardinality."
  action      = "drop_attributes_from_metric_aggregates"
  nrql        = "SELECT containerId FROM Metric"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

  * `account_id` - (Optional) Account where the drop rule will be put. Defaults to the account associated with the API key used.
  * `description` - (Optional) The description of the drop rule.
  * `nrql` - (Required) A NRQL string that specifies what data types to drop.
  * `action` - (Required) An action type specifying how to apply the NRQL string (either `drop_data`, `drop_attributes`, or ` drop_attributes_from_metric_aggregates`).

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

  * `rule_id` - The id, uniquely identifying the rule.

## Using `newrelic-cli` to List Out Drop Rules

All NRQL Drop Rules associated with a New Relic account may be listed out using the following newrelic-cli command:
```bash
newrelic nrql droprules
```
This would print all drop rules associated with your New Relic account to the terminal.
The number of rules to be printed can be customized using the `limit` argument of this command.
For instance, the following command limits the number of drop rules printed to two.
```bash
newrelic nrql droprules --limit 2
```
More details on the command and its arguments (for instance, the format in which the droprules are to be listed in the terminal, which is JSON by default) can be found in the output of the `newrelic nrql droprules --help` command.
If you do not have **newrelic-cli** installed on your device already, head over to [this page](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli#installation--upgrades) for instructions.

## Import

New Relic NRQL drop rules can be imported using a concatenated string of the format
 `<account_id>:<rule_id>`, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import newrelic_nrql_drop_rule.foo 12345:34567
```
