# Resource: newrelic\_user

The `newrelic_user` resource may be used to create, update and delete users in New Relic.

## Example Usage
```hcl
data "newrelic_authentication_domain" "foo" {
  name = "Test Authentication Domain"
}

resource "newrelic_user" "foo" {
  name                     = "Test New User"
  email_id                 = "test_user@test.com"
  authentication_domain_id = data.newrelic_authentication_domain.foo.id
  user_type                = "CORE_USER_TIER"
}
```

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the user to be created.
* `email_id` - (Required) The email ID of the user to be created.
* `authentication_domain_id` - (Required) The ID of the authentication domain to which the user to be created would belong.
* `user_type` - (Optional) The tier to which the user to be created would belong. Accepted values for this argument are `BASIC_USER_TIER`, `CORE_USER_TIER`, or `FULL_USER_TIER`. If not specified in the configuration, the argument would default to `BASIC_USER_TIER`.

-> **NOTE** The ID of an authentication domain can be retrieved using its name, via the data source `newrelic_authentication_domain`, as shown in the example above. Head over to the documentation of this data source for more details and examples.

~> **WARNING:** Changing the `authentication_domain_id` of a `newrelic_user` resource that has already been applied would result in a **replacement** of the resource â€“ destruction of the existing resource, followed by the addition of a new resource with the specified configuration. This is due to the fact that updating the `authentication_domain_id` of an existing user is not supported.

## Attributes Reference
In addition to the attributes listed above, the following attribute is also exported by this resource:

* `id` - The ID of the created user.

## Import
A user can be imported using its ID. Example:

```shell
$ terraform import newrelic_user.foo 1999999999
```
