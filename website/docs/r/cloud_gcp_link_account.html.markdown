# Resource: newrelic_cloud_gcp_link_account

Use this resource to link a GCP account to New Relic.

## Prerequisite

To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever.

Setup is required in GCP for this resource to work properly. The New Relic GCP integration can be done by creating a user account or a service account.

A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project.

In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role.

Follow the [steps outlined here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/get-started/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-new-relic) to set up the integration.
