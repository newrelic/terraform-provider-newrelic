# Resource: newrelic\_workload

Use this resource to create, update, and delete a New Relic One workload.

A New Relic User API key is required to provision this resource.  Set the `api_key`
attribute in the `provider` block or the `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` environment
variable with your User API key.

## Example Usage

Include entities with a certain string on the name.
```hcl
resource "newrelic_workload" "foo" {
	name = "Example workload"
	account_id = 12345678

	entity_guids = ["MjUyMDUyOHxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MjE1MDM3Nzk1"]

	entity_search_query {
		query = "name like '%Example application%'"
	}

	scope_account_ids =  [12345678]
}
```

Include entities with a set of tags.
```hcl
resource "newrelic_workload" "foo" {
	name = "Example workload with tags"
	account_id = 12345678

	entity_guids = ["MjUyMDUyOHxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MjE1MDM3Nzk1"]

	entity_search_query {
		query = "tags.accountId = '12345678' AND tags.environment='production' AND tags.language='java'"
	}

	scope_account_ids =  [12345678]
}
```

Include entities with a set of tags.
```hcl
resource "newrelic_workload" "foo" {
	name = "Example workload with tags"
	account_id = 12345678

	entity_guids = ["MjUyMDUyOHxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MjE1MDM3Nzk1"]

	entity_search_query {
		query = "tags.accountId = '12345678' AND tags.environment='production' AND tags.language='java'"
	}

	scope_account_ids =  [12345678]
}
```

Include automatic status

-> The global status of your workload is a quick indicator of the workload health. You can configure it to be calculated automatically, and you can also set an alert and get a notification whenever the workload stops being operational. Alternatively, you can communicate a certain status of the workload by setting up a static value and a description. [See our docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/workloads/use-workloads/workloads/workload-status)


```hcl
resource "newrelic_workload" "foo" {
  name       = "Example workload"
  account_id = 12345678

  entity_guids = ["MjUyMDUyOHxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MjE1MDM3Nzk1"]

  entity_search_query {
    query = "name like '%Example application%'"
  }

  scope_account_ids = [12345678]

  description = "Description"

  status_config_automatic {
    enabled = true
    remaining_entities_rule {
      remaining_entities_rule_rollup {
        strategy        = "BEST_STATUS_WINS"
        threshold_type  = "FIXED"
        threshold_value = 100
        group_by        = "ENTITY_TYPE"
      }
    }
    rule {
      entity_guids = ["MjUyMDUyOHxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MjE1MDM3Nzk1"]
      nrql_query {
        query = "name like '%Example application2%'"
      }
      rollup {
        strategy        = "BEST_STATUS_WINS"
        threshold_type  = "FIXED"
        threshold_value = 100
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Include static status

-> You can use this during maintenance tasks or any other time you want to provide a fixed status for your workload. This overrides all automatic rules. [See our docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/workloads/use-workloads/workloads/workload-status#configure-static)

```hcl
resource "newrelic_workload" "foo" {
  name       = "Example workload"
  account_id = 12345678

  entity_guids = ["MjUyMDUyOHxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MjE1MDM3Nzk1"]

  entity_search_query {
    query = "name like '%Example application%'"
  }

  scope_account_ids = [12345678]

  description = "Description"

  status_config_static {
    description = "test"
    enabled     = true
    status      = "OPERATIONAL"
    summary     = "summary of the status"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

### Nested `rule` blocks

All nested `rule` blocks support the following common arguments:

  * `entity_guids` - (Optional) A list of entity GUIDs composing the rule. At least one of `entity_guids` or `nrql_query` must be defined.
  * `nrql_query` - (Optional) A list of entity search queries used to retrieve the entities that compose the rule. See [Nested nrql_query blocks](#nested-nrql_query-blocks) below for details. At least one of `entity_guids` or `nrql_query` must be defined.

 `<account_id>:<workload_id>:<guid>`, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import newrelic_workload.foo 12345678:1456:MjUyMDUyOHxBUE18QVBRTElDQVRJT058MjE1MDM3Nzk1
