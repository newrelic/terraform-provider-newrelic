    Link an AWS account to New Relic.

# Resource: newrelic\_cloud\_aws\_link\_account

Use this resource to link an AWS account to New Relic.

## Prerequisite

Setup is required in AWS for this resource to work properly. The New Relic AWS integration can be set up to pull metrics from AWS services or AWS can push metrics to New Relic using CloudWatch Metric Streams.

Using a metric stream to New Relic is the preferred way to integrate with AWS. Follow the [steps outlined here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream/#set-up-metric-stream) to set up a metric stream.

To pull data from AWS instead, complete the [steps outlined here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring#connect).

## Example Usage

You can also use the [full example, including the AWS set up, found in our guides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/guides/cloud_integrations_guide#aws).

```hcl
resource "newrelic_cloud_aws_link_account" "foo" {
  arn = "arn:aws:service:region:account-id:resource-id"
  metric_collection_mode = "PUSH"
  name = "account name"
}
```
## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `account_id` - (Optional) The New Relic account ID to operate on.  This allows the user to override the `account_id` attribute set on the provider. Defaults to the environment variable `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID`.
* `arn` - (Required) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role.
* `metric_collection_mode` - (Optional) How metrics will be collected. Use `PUSH` for a metric stream or `PULL` to integrate with individual services.
* `name` - (Required) - The linked account name

-> **WARNING:** Starting with [v3.27.2](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/3.27.2) of the New Relic Terraform Provider, updating any of the aforementioned attributes (except `name`) of a `newrelic_cloud_aws_link_account` resource that has been applied would **force a replacement** of the resource (destruction of the resource, followed by the creation of a new resource). Please carefully review the output of `terraform plan`, which would clearly indicate a replacement of this resource, before performing a `terraform apply`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the AWS linked account.

## Import

Linked AWS accounts can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import newrelic_cloud_aws_link_account.foo <id>
```
