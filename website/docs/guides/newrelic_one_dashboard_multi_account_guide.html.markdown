## Guide: Upgrading to Multi-Account Queries with the **account_id** Attribute in newrelic_one_dashboard resource

To support querying across multiple accounts in a single widget, the `account_id` attribute has been upgraded.

This guide explains what has changed, why it changed, and how to use the new, more powerful functionality.

### Why the Change?

Previously, each `nrql_query` could only target a single New Relic account. The primary motivation for this update was to **enable multi-account NRQL queries**, a highly requested feature that allows you to build much more powerful and consolidated dashboards.

To achieve this without introducing breaking changes or confusing new attributes, we've made the existing `account_id` attribute more flexible.

--- 

### How to Use the New `account_id`

The `account_id` attribute now accepts both a single ID (as before) and a list of IDs for multi-account queries.

### For a Single Account ID

There is **no change** to how you configure a single account. You can continue to provide the account ID as a plain number.

```hcl
resource "newrelic_one_dashboard" "example" {
  # ...
  page {
    widget_bar {
      title = "Single Account Widget"
      nrql_query {
        # This syntax remains the same.
        account_id = 1234567
        query      = "SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Multiple Account IDs (New)
To query multiple accounts, provide a list of numbers to the account_id attribute using the built-in jsonencode() function.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Using jsonencode() is the standard and safest way to provide a list or complex type as a string to a Terraform attribute.

```hcl
resource "newrelic_one_dashboard" "example" {
  page {
    widget_line {
      title = "Multi-Account Widget"
      nrql_query {
        # Use jsonencode() to provide a list of account IDs.
        account_id = jsonencode([1234567, 9876543, 5554443])
        query      = "SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ Upgrading from a Previous Version
We have designed this change to be 100% backward-compatible. Your existing dashboard configurations will continue to work without any manual changes required from you.

When you upgrade your provider to this new version:

terraform plan: The first time you run plan, it will show "No changes" for your existing resources. Our provider automatically handles the state migration in the background.

terraform apply: When you run apply, Terraform will seamlessly update your state file to the new format without modifying your infrastructure.

You can confidently upgrade the provider version and continue managing your existing dashboards. You only need to use the new jsonencode() syntax when you want to create or update a widget to query multiple accounts.

Complete Before-and-After Example
Here is a full example showing how you might evolve your HCL file.

Before (Old Provider Version)
Terraform

### main.tf with the old provider version

```hcl
resource "newrelic_one_dashboard" "my_dashboard" {
  name = "Production Overview"
  page {
    name = "Services"
    widget_table {
      title  = "Transaction Errors (App A)"
      row    = 1
      column = 1
      nrql_query {
        account_id = 1111111
        query      = "SELECT count(*) FROM TransactionError FACET appName"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
After (New Provider Version)
Notice how the existing widget for App A is untouched. We've simply added a new multi-account widget.


### main.tf after updating the provider version
```hcl
resource "newrelic_one_dashboard" "my_dashboard" {
  name = "Production Overview"
  page {
    name = "Services"

    # This existing widget requires NO changes.
    widget_table {
      title  = "Transaction Errors (App A)"
      row    = 1
      column = 1
      nrql_query {
        account_id = 1111111 # Still works perfectly.
        query      = "SELECT count(*) FROM TransactionError FACET appName"
      }
    }

    # NEW: A second widget querying multiple accounts.
    widget_line {
      title  = "Combined API Gateway Throughput"
      row    = 1
      column = 2
      nrql_query {
        account_id = jsonencode([1111111, 2222222, 3333333])
        query      = "SELECT rate(count(*), 1 minute) FROM ApiGatewaySample"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
