## Migrating to NRQL Alert Conditions

Certain subtypes of Alert Conditions (Synthetics Alert Condition and Infra Alert Condition) have been removed in favor of NRQL Alert Conditions.

Users wanting to migrate alert conditions will need to make a few adjustments to their configuration, by following the examples outlined below.

### newrelic_synthetics_alert_condition

Example newrelic_synthetics_alert_condition:
```
resource "newrelic_synthetics_alert_condition" "foo" {
  policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.foo.id

  name        = "foo synthetics condition"
  monitor_id  = newrelic_synthetics_monitor.foo.id
  runbook_url = "https://www.example.com"
}
```

Migration to newrelic_nrql_alert_condition:
```
resource "newrelic_nrql_alert_condition" "foo" {
  policy_id                      = newrelic_alert_policy.foo.id
  type                           = "static"
  name                           = "foo synthetics condition"
  description                    = "Alert when transactions are taking too long"
  runbook_url                    = "https://www.example.com"
  enabled                        = true
  violation_time_limit_seconds   = 3600
  fill_option                    = "static"
  fill_value                     = 1.0
  aggregation_window             = 60
  aggregation_method             = "event_flow"
  aggregation_delay              = 120
  expiration_duration            = 120
  open_violation_on_expiration   = true
  close_violations_on_expiration = true
  slide_by                       = 30

  nrql {
    query = "SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'FAILED') FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE NOT isMuted AND entityGuid IN ('${newrelic_synthetics_monitor.foo.id}') FACET entityGuid, location"
  }

  critical {
    operator              = "above"
    threshold             = 0
    threshold_duration    = 60
    threshold_occurrences = "ALL"
  }
}
```

### newrelic_infra_alert_condition: High disk usage

Example newrelic_infra_alert_condition:
```
resource "newrelic_infra_alert_condition" "high_disk_usage" {
  policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.foo.id

  name        = "High disk usage"
  description = "Warning if disk usage goes above 80% and critical alert if goes above 90%"
  type        = "infra_metric"
  event       = "StorageSample"
  select      = "diskUsedPercent"
  comparison  = "above"
  where       = "(hostname LIKE '%frontend%')"

  critical {
    duration      = 25
    value         = 90
    time_function = "all"
  }

  warning {
    duration      = 10
    value         = 80
    time_function = "all"
  }
}
```
