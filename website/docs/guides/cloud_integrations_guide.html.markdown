## New Relic Terraform Provider Cloud integrations example for AWS, GCP, Azure, and OCI

The [New Relic Cloud integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations/) collect data from cloud platform services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations and they do not require the use of our infrastructure agent: you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account. This guide describes the process of enabling the New Relic cloud integrations fully automated through Terraform.

We have different instructions for each cloud provider, use the links below to go the relevant sections:

- [AWS](#aws)
- [Azure](#azure)
- [Google Cloud Platform](#gcp)
- [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](#oci)

If you encounter issues or bugs, please [report those on Github repository](https://github.com/newrelic/terraform-provider-newrelic/issues/new/choose).

### AWS

The New Relic AWS integration relies on two mechanisms to get data in New Relic: [AWS Metric stream](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/) and [AWS Polling integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring). For the majority of AWS services the AWS Metric stream is used as it [has many advantages compared to polling](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream#why-it-matters). AWS Polling integrations are also enabled because AWS does not yet [support all metrics through AWS Metric Stream](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream#integrations-not-replaced-streams). 

The following AWS services may be integrated via API Polling, using the New Relic Terraform Provider. A combination of these services may be added to the Terraform Configuration, to set up an AWS Integration comprising these services via API Polling. More [examples](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/cloud_aws_integrations#example-usage) and [details](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/cloud_aws_integrations#argument-reference) on the arguments needed to set up each service can be found in the documentation of the [`newrelic_cloud_aws_integrations`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/cloud_aws_integrations) resource.

<a id="oci"></a>
### Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

The New Relic OCI integration collects metrics, logs, and metadata from supported OCI services and sends them to your New Relic account. This integration uses a combination of:

* Service Connector Hub pipelines (for metrics / logs export)
* Functions for data transformation and payload enrichment
* API polling to supplement metadata and tags

#### Supported OCI service categories

The following OCI namespaces are supported by New Relic for metrics/logs collection via Service Connector Hub. These namespaces correspond to different OCI services and can be used when configuring your Service Connector Hub to export metrics to New Relic.

|                            |                                    |                             |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------| 
| `API Gateway`              | `Block Storage`                    | `Compute`                   |
| `Compute Agent`            | `Compute Infrastructure Health`    | `Compute Instance Health`   |
| `Container Engine (OKE)`   | `Container Instance`               | `Functions (FaaS)`          |
| `Health Checks`            | `Instance Pools`                   | `Load Balancer (LBaaS)`     |
| `Logging`                  | `Network Load Balancer`            | `Object Storage`            |
| `PostgreSQL`               | `Queue`                            | `Service Connector Hub`     |
| `Streaming`                |                                    |                             |

#### Modular OCI setup

The modular approach allows you to deploy only the specific OCI integration components you need, with clear separation between policy setup and data collection integrations. This design enables flexible deployment strategies where policy configuration can be managed independently from metrics and logging integrations.

The following composable modules are available under `examples/modules/cloud-integrations/oci/` so you can provision only what you need:

* `policy-setup` – Creates IAM policies and identity trust / configuration prerequisites (including workload identity federation inputs) required to link an OCI tenancy to New Relic.
* `metrics-integration` – Creates Service Connector Hub resources, optional networking (VCN / subnets), and supporting artifacts that export metrics (and optionally logs) to New Relic.
* `logs-integration` – Creates connector hubs, function and function app to export logs from Oracle Cloud to New Relic.

Use them independently or combine them in the same configuration. In all cases, the `policy-setup` module must be applied successfully before the `metrics-integration` or `logging-integration` module, because the latter depends on IAM policies, dynamic groups / identity trust, and (if configured) workload identity federation artifacts created by the former.

> **NOTE:** These modules assume both the New Relic and OCI providers are already configured. See: [New Relic getting started](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/guides/getting_started) and [OCI provider setup](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs).

#### Example: Policy setup module

```hcl
module "oci_policy_setup" {
  source = "github.com/newrelic/terraform-provider-newrelic//examples/modules/cloud-integrations/oci/policy-setup"

  tenancy_ocid      = "ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaexampletenancy"
  region            = "iad"
  fingerprint       = "12:34:56:78:9a:bc:de:f0:12:34:56:78:9a:bc:de:f0"
  private_key       = "USER_PVT_KEY"

  # New Relic linkage / API keys (dummy values)
  newrelic_account_id      = 1234567
  newrelic_ingest_api_key  = "NRII-INGEST-API-KEY-EXAMPLE"
  newrelic_user_api_key    = "NRAA-USER-API-KEY-EXAMPLE"
  newrelic_provider_region = "US" # or "EU"

  # Workload Identity Federation / OAuth2 (sample values)
  client_id      = "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee"
  client_secret  = "super-secret-client-value"
  oci_domain_url = "https://idcs-abcdef1234567890.identity.oraclecloud.com"
  svc_user_name  = "svc-newrelic-wif"

  # Enable metrics & logs policies (example)
  instrumentation_type = "METRICS,LOGS"
}
```

Key variables:

* `instrumentation_type` – Comma‑separated list of any of `METRICS`, `LOGS`, `METRICS,LOGS` controlling which policy sets are deployed.
* `client_id`, `client_secret`, `oci_domain_url`, `svc_user_name` – Workload identity federation (OAuth2) inputs (see the [OCI link account](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/cloud_oci_link_account) resource docs for guidance).
* `newrelic_provider_region` – Region context for New Relic provider operations (for example, `US` or `EU`).

#### Example: Metrics integration module

```hcl
module "oci_metrics_integration" {
  source = "github.com/newrelic/terraform-provider-newrelic//examples/modules/cloud-integrations/oci/metrics-integration"

  tenancy_ocid     = "ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaexampletenancy"
  compartment_ocid = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..bbbbbbbbexamplecmp" # or module.oci_policy_setup.compartment_ocid
  region           = "iad"
  fingerprint      = "12:34:56:78:9a:bc:de:f0:12:34:56:78:9a:bc:de:f0"
  private_key       = "USER_PVT_KEY"

  # Endpoint selection (validated internally)
  newrelic_endpoint = "newrelic-metric-api" # or newrelic-eu-metric-api

  # Networking
  create_vcn         = true
  function_subnet_id = "" # ignored when create_vcn = true

  # Vault secret OCIDs (dummy)
  ingest_api_secret_ocid = "ocid1.vaultsecret.oc1..dddddddigingestsecret" # or module.oci_policy_setup.ingest_vault_ocid
  user_api_secret_ocid   = "ocid1.vaultsecret.oc1..eeeeeeeeusersecret123" # or module.oci_policy_setup.user_vault_ocid

  connector_hubs_data = "[{\"compartments\":[{\"compartment_id\":\"ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaexampletenancy\",\"namespaces\":[\"oci_faas\"]}],\"description\":\"[DO NOT DELETE] New Relic Metrics Connector Hub\",\"name\":\"newrelic-metrics-connector-hub-us-ashburn\"}]"
}
```

Key variables:

* `create_vcn` / `function_subnet_id` – Networking control. Set `create_vcn=false` and provide an existing `function_subnet_id` to reuse existing infrastructure.
* `connector_hubs_data` – A JSON *string* (must be valid, stringified JSON) whose root is an array of connector hub definition objects. 
  
  Each object supports:
  * `compartments` (array of objects with `compartment_id` and `namespaces` (array of strings))
  * `description` (string)
  * `name` (string)
  The example above shows a single‑element JSON array wrapped in quotes to satisfy Terraform's string input expectation. Example object structure:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "compartments": [
        {
          "compartment_id": "ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaexampletenancy",
          "namespaces": ["oci_faas"]
        }
      ],
      "description": "[DO NOT DELETE] New Relic Metrics Connector Hub",
      "name": "newrelic-metrics-connector-hub-us-ashburn"
    }
  ]
  ```
* `ingest_api_secret_ocid` / `user_api_secret_ocid` – Vault secret OCIDs for ingest and user API keys (avoid embedding plain‑text keys).
* `newrelic_endpoint` – Logical endpoint selector; the module maps this value to the actual metric ingest URL (use the EU variant for EU accounts).
* `region` – OCI region key (short code) where resources for this module are created (for example: `iad`, `phx`, `fra`). Provide ONLY the region key, not the full region identifier (so use `iad` instead of `us-ashburn-1`).

#### Example: Logs integration module

```hcl
module "oci_logs_integration" {
  source = "github.com/newrelic/terraform-provider-newrelic/examples/modules/cloud-integrations/oci/logs-integration"

  # oci configuration
  tenancy_ocid = "ocid1.tenancy.oc1..***"
  compartment_ocid = module.oci_policy_setup.compartment_ocid
  region = "us-ashburn-1"
  
  # new relic logging prefix
  newrelic_logging_identifier = "logs"
  
  # network components
  create_vcn = true # set to false to reuse existing VCN/subnet created from metrics module
  function_subnet_id = module.oci_metrics_integration.vcn_network_details.subnet_id # ignored when create_vcn = true
  
  # function application environment variables configuration
  image_version = "latest" # latest image version for the logging function
  debug_enabled = "FALSE"
  new_relic_region = "US"
  secret_ocid = module.oci_policy_setup.ingest_vault_ocid
  
  # connector hub configuration (Optional)
  # Don't add the following variables if you want to skip log export.
  connector_hub_details = "[{\"display_name\":\"newrelic-logs-connector\",\"description\":\"Service connector for logs from compartment A to New Relic\",\"log_sources\":[{\"compartment_id\":\"ocid1.tenancy.oc1..***\",\"log_group_id\":\"ocid1.loggroup.oc1.iad.***\"}]}]"
  batch_size_in_kbs = 6000 # max payload size in KBs (default 6000)
  batch_time_in_sec = 60 # max wait time in seconds before sending batch (default 60)
}
```

Key variables:

- network components:
  - `create_vcn`: set to false to reuse existing VCN/subnet created from metrics module. 
  - `function_subnet_id`: subnet OCID for the function to be created in. Ignored if create_vcn is true.
> If you want to use an existing private subnet, make sure it has required route rules and gateways with internet and all OCI services access. 
- function application environment variables configuration:
  - `debug_enabled`: Boolean to enable or disable function debug logs.
  - `new_relic_region`: The New Relic region (US or EU).
  - `secret_ocid`: The OCID of the secret in OCI Vault containing New Relic License Key.
- connector hub configuration: A JSON *string* (must be valid, stringified JSON) whose root is an array of connector hub definition objects. Each object supports:
  * `display_name` (string) : name of the connector hub - must have prefix `newrelic-logs`
  * `description` (string) (optional): connector hub description
  * `log_sources`: 
    * list of compartment OCID and log group OCID

The example above shows a single‑element JSON array wrapped in quotes to satisfy Terraform's string input expectation. Example object structure:
     
```json
[

> When implementing the New Relic OCI integration, the `policy-setup` module must always be applied before the `metrics-integration` or `logging-integration` modules. These modules can be run together in a single Terraform configuration only if the dependency graph can be successfully resolved. For example, this can be achieved by referencing outputs from the `policy-setup` module in the other integration modules. Failure to apply the necessary policies first will result in authorization errors when creating Service Connector Hub resources or invoking functions.
