## New Relic Terraform Provider Cloud integrations example for AWS, GCP and Azure

The New Relic cloud integrations collect data from cloud platform services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations and they do not require the use of our infrastructure agent: you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account. This guide describes the process of enabling the New Relic cloud integrations fully automated through Terraform.

### Requirements

* AWS, Azure or GCP account with administrator permissions
* New Relic account with admin permissions

### Documentation

* [New Relic Cloud integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations/)

### Examples

Below you can find the full code examples, and required variables for each of the full end to end examples.

#### AWS

The AWS integration relies on two mechanisms to get data in New Relic: [AWS Metric stream](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream/) and [AWS Polling integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring). For the majority of AWS services the AWS Metric stream is used as it [has many advantages compared to polling](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream#why-it-matters). The AWS Polling integrations are also enabled because AWS does not yet [support all metrics through AWS Metric Stream](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream#integrations-not-replaced-streams). We enable `AWS Billing`, `AWS CloudTrail`, `AWS Health`, `AWS Trusted Advisor` and `AWS X-Ray`. Feel free to adapt the example to your needs.

Variables:

* NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The New Relic account you want to link to AWS
* NEW_RELIC_CLOUDWATCH_ENDPOINT: The datacenter where your New Relic account is located.

#### Azure

The Microsoft Azure integrations reports data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account.

This example will integrate the following resources: `API Management`, `App Gateway`, `App Service`, `Containers`, `Cosmos DB`, `Cost Management`, `Data Factory`, `Eventhub`, `Express Route`, `Firewalls`, `FrontDoor`, `Functions`, `KeyVault`, `Load Balancer`, `Logic apps`, `Machine learning`, `MariaDB`, `Mysql`, `Postgresql`, `PowerBI Dedicated`, `Redis cache`, `Service Bus`, `Sql`, `Sql Managed`, `Storage`, `Virtual Machine`, `Virtual Networks`, `Vms`, and `VPN gateway`. Feel free to adapt the example to your needs.

Link: https://github.com/newrelic/terraform-provider-newrelic/blob/main/examples/cloud-integrations-aws.tf

Variables:

* NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The New Relic account you want to link to Azure.
* NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_NAME: The name of the integration in New Relic. This is usefull if you need to link more than one Azure account.

#### GCP

The Google Cloud Platform integrations reports data from various GCP services to your New Relic account.

This example will integrate the following resources: `App Engine`, `BigQuery`, `Cloud Functions`, `Cloud Load Balancing`, `Cloud Pub/Sub`, `Cloud Spanner`, `Cloud SQL`, `Cloud Storage`, `Compute Engine`, and `Kubernetes Engine`. Feel free to adapt the example to your needs.

Link: https://github.com/newrelic/terraform-provider-newrelic/blob/main/examples/cloud-integrations-gcp.tf

Variables:

* NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The New Relic account you want to link to GCP.
* NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_NAME: The name of the integration in New Relic. This is usefull if you need to link more than one Azure account.
* NEW_RELIC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID: The ID of the New Relic GCP [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) with [Viewer and Service Usage Consumer roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles). You can find this ID in the New Relic UI by going to `Infrastructure > GCP > Add a GCP project`. For more information [check out the New Relic docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/get-started/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-new-relic/).
* GCP_PROJECT_ID: The ID of the project you want to receive data from in GCP.
