## NRQL Drop Rules EOL: Implications and Actions Needed 🚨

### About the EOL

As announced by New Relic ([see this announcement](https://docs.newrelic.com/eol/2025/05/drop-rule-filter/)), the <b style="color:red;">end-of-life (EOL)</b> for the **Drop Rules API** will take effect on <b style="color:red;">January 7, 2026</b>. Consequently, support for managing drop rules via the New Relic Terraform Provider's [`newrelic_nrql_drop_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/nrql_drop_rule) resource <b style="color:maroon;">will also officially end on January 7, 2026</b>. After the EOL is effective, all API requests made by the Terraform provider using the [`newrelic_nrql_drop_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/nrql_drop_rule) resource <span style="color:red;">will be blocked and result in an API error</span>.

In line with these changes, the [`newrelic_nrql_drop_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/nrql_drop_rule) resource <span style="color:red;">has been marked as <b>deprecated</b></span> starting with <b style="color:red;">v3.68.0</b> of the New Relic Terraform Provider. <span style="color:red;">It will be <b>removed</b> from the provider in a future release coinciding with the January 7, 2026 EOL</span>. This means the resource can no longer be used to create or manage drop rules after this date.

### Alternatives and Action Needed

NRQL Drop Rules are being replaced by **Pipeline Cloud Rules**. See [this article](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-control/pipeline-control/cloud-rules-api/) for an overview.

New Relic will handle the upstream migration of existing NRQL Drop Rules to Pipeline Cloud Rules. However, to continue managing these NRQL Drop Rules as Pipeline Cloud Rules, in their new definition (and any new Pipeline Cloud Rules) via Terraform, <span style="color:tomato;">customers using the [`newrelic_nrql_drop_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/nrql_drop_rule) resource must transition to the new [`newrelic_pipeline_cloud_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/pipeline_cloud_rule) resource.</span> Please see [this page](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/pipeline_cloud_rule) for documentation on using the [`newrelic_pipeline_cloud_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/pipeline_cloud_rule) resource.

To transition to the [`newrelic_pipeline_cloud_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/pipeline_cloud_rule) resource for rules already migrated upstream by New Relic, you will need to:
- **_Import_** the existing Pipeline Cloud Rules (which were formerly NRQL Drop Rules) into your Terraform state as [`newrelic_pipeline_cloud_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/pipeline_cloud_rule) resources using the `terraform import` command with the ID(s) of Pipeline Cloud Rules. See [this page](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/pipeline_cloud_rule#import) for details on how to import a Pipeline Cloud Rule. 
  - To simplify this process, you can pair the import (in a different form) with `terraform plan -generate-config-out` to automatically generate the corresponding resource configuration, as explained [here, in the Terraform docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import/generating-configuration).
  - <span style="color:tomato;">Note that the ID of a Pipeline Cloud Rule is _not the same_ as the ID of the corresponding NRQL Drop Rule.</span>
  - To import a Pipeline Cloud Rule (as a [`newrelic_pipeline_cloud_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/pipeline_cloud_rule) resource) corresponding to an existing [`newrelic_nrql_drop_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/nrql_drop_rule) resource in your configuration, upgrade to **v3.68.0** or greater of the New Relic Terraform Provider, refresh and apply your configuration comprising the [`newrelic_nrql_drop_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/nrql_drop_rule) resources, which would allow an argument [`pipeline_cloud_rule_entity_id`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/nrql_drop_rule#pipeline_cloud_rule_entity_id-1) to be exported by the updated [`newrelic_nrql_drop_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/nrql_drop_rule) resources. 
  - The value of this argument, e.g. `newrelic_nrql_drop_rule.foo.pipeline_cloud_rule_entity_id` can then be used as the ID to import the corresponding Pipeline Cloud Rule, to import and generate configuration as stated in the above steps and the example below, or with the `terraform import` command too.
  ```hcl
  import {
    to = newrelic_pipeline_cloud_rule.foo
    id = "MXxXX0XXxXXXXXXXXX5XX0XXX1XXX1XXXXX8XXX5XXXxX2XxXxxxXX03XXX2XXx0XXXxXXXxXxXxXXXxXXXx"
    
    # id = newrelic_nrql_drop_rule.foo.pipeline_cloud_rule_entity_id
    
    # The ID of a Pipeline Cloud Rule (to be imported
    # as a `newrelic_pipeline_cloud_rule` resource) 
    # corresponding to an existing `newrelic_nrql_drop_rule` resource
    # can be exported from the `newrelic_nrql_drop_rule` resource 
    # from the argument `pipeline_cloud_rule_entity_id`, 
    # when on version >= 3.68.0 of the provider.
    # See the note above (in the migration guide) for details.
  }
  ```
 - **_Remove_** all references to the [`newrelic_nrql_drop_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/nrql_drop_rule) resources from the Terraform state (after successfully importing them as [`newrelic_pipeline_cloud_rule`](/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/resources/pipeline_cloud_rule) resources) using the `terraform state rm` command. See [this page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/state/rm) for details on removing items from the Terraform state.

The process outlined above is our recommendation for migrating to Pipeline Cloud Rules. We are exploring ways to assist with automating this migration in certain scenarios and will share updates and resources here as they become available.
