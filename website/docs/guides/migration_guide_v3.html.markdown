## Upgrade to v3.x of the New Relic Terraform Provider

Version 3.x of the provider uses a new underlying API for Synthetics. This results in some changes that will need to be made to existing Synthetics resource to keep them compatible with the new API.

### Migrating script Synthetics monitor resources

The v2 `newrelic_synthetics_monitor_resource` has been split into two new resources: `newrelic_synthetics_monitor_resource` and `newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor_resource`. Previously a monitor script had to be defined separately from a Synthetics Monitor using the `newrelic_synthetics_monitor_script_resource`. In v3 a script is attached directly to a scripted monitor. See the below example for how to migrate to version 3:

v2
```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_monitor" "monitor" {
  name      = "monitor-name"
  type      = "SCRIPT_BROWSER"
  frequency = 1
  status    = "DISABLED"
  locations = ["AWS_US_EAST_1"]
  uri       = "https://google.com"
}
resource "newrelic_synthetics_monitor_script" "monitor_script" {
  monitor_id = newrelic_synthetics_monitor.monitor.id
  text       = "console.log('hello, world')"
  location {
    name = "AWS_US_EAST_1"
  }
}
```

v3
```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor" "monitor" {
  name            = "monitor-name"
  type            = "SCRIPT_API"
  locations_public = ["US_EAST_1"]
  period          = "EVERY_HOUR"
  status          = "ENABLED"
  script          = "console.log('hello, world')"
  tag {
    key    = "some_key"
    values = ["some_value"]
  }
}

```

#### Steps to migrate to new resource

1. Move the value in `text` from `newrelic_synthetics_monitor_script` to `script` in `newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor`
2. Remove `AWS_` from the location name, e.g. `AWS_US_EAST_1` becomes `US_EAST_1`
3. Rename `frequency` to `period` and change to one of the valid values - EVERY_MINUTE, EVERY_5_MINUTES, EVERY_10_MINUTES, EVERY_15_MINUTES, EVERY_30_MINUTES, EVERY_HOUR, EVERY_6_HOURS, EVERY_12_HOURS, or EVERY_DAY
4. Run `terraform state rm newrelic_synthetics_monitor.<your_monitor_name>` and then log in to New Relic to find your monitor guid.
5. Using the guid e.g. `MTk2MQxYjk3YWIzLWZlM05JVE9SfDQxYj...` run `terraform import newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor.<your_monitor_name> guid` to continue managing your existing monitor in Terraform. There won't be any down time, only a brief moment where your monitor is not managed by Terraform.

### Migrating script Synthetics monitor resources with VSE

In v3.x of the provider, we have introduced a new resource `newrelic_synthetics_private_location` for creating a private location to attach to a monitor. Previously, an HMAC for a private location had to be calculated for a monitor script to run in a private location. This has been replaced by the private location GUID. See the below example for how to migrate to version 3:

v2
```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_monitor" "foo" {
  name      = "monitor-name"
  type      = "SCRIPT_BROWSER"
  frequency = 1
  status    = "DISABLED"
  locations = ["AWS_US_EAST_1"]
  uri       = "https://google.com"
}

resource "newrelic_synthetics_monitor_script" "foo_script" {
  monitor_id = newrelic_synthetics_monitor.foo.id
  text       = "console.log('hello, world')"
  location {
    name         = "private-location"
    vse_password = "secret"
  }
}
```

v3
```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_private_location" "private_location" {
  description               = "Test Private Location"
  name                      = "test-private-location"
  verified_script_execution = true
}

resource "newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor" "monitor" {
  location_private {
    guid         = newrelic_synthetics_private_location.private_location.id
    vse_password = secret
  }
  name                 = "test-monitor"
  period               = "EVERY_HOUR"
  runtime_type_version = ""
  runtime_type         = ""
  script_language      = ""
  status               = "ENABLED"
  type                 = "SCRIPT_BROWSER"
  script               = "console.log('hello, world')"
  tag {
    key    = "some_key"
    values = ["some_value"]
  }
}
```

#### Steps to migrate to new resource

1. Follow the guide above to migrate to the new `newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor` resource
2. Create or import a private location using the `newrelic_synthetics_private_location` resource
3. Add a `location_private` block to the `newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor` resource with the `guid` of the private location and the `vse_password`
