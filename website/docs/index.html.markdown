## Authentication Requirements

This provider is in the midst of migrating away from our older REST based APIs
to a newer GraphQL based API that we lovingly call NerdGraph.  During this
transition, the provider will be using different endpoints depending on which
resource is in use.  Below is a table that reflects the current state of the
resources compared to which endpoint is in use.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the New Relic provider
provider "newrelic" {
  account_id = <Your Account ID>
  api_key = <Your Personal API Key>    # usually prefixed with 'NRAK'
  admin_api_key = <Your Admin API Key> # usually prefixed with 'NRAA'
  region = "US"                        # Valid regions are US and EU
}

# Read an APM application resource
data "newrelic_entity" "foo" {
  name = "Your App Name"
  domain = "APM"
  type = "APPLICATION"
}

# Create an alert policy
resource "newrelic_alert_policy" "alert" {
  name = "Your Concise Alert Name"
}

# Add a condition
resource "newrelic_nrql_alert_condition" "foo" {
  policy_id            = newrelic_alert_policy.alert.id
  type                 = "static"
  name                 = "foo"
  description          = "Alert when transactions are taking too long"
  runbook_url          = "https://www.example.com"
  enabled              = true
  value_function       = "single_value"
  violation_time_limit = "one_hour"

  nrql {
    query             = "SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction where appName = '${data.newrelic_entity.foo.name}'"
    evaluation_offset = 3
  }

  critical {
    operator              = "above"
    threshold             = 5.5
    threshold_duration    = 300
    threshold_occurrences = "ALL"
  }
}

# Add a notification channel
resource "newrelic_alert_channel" "email" {
  name = "email"
  type = "email"

  config {
    recipients              = "username@example.com"
    include_json_attachment = "1"
  }
}

# Link the channel to the policy
resource "newrelic_alert_policy_channel" "alert_email" {
  policy_id  = newrelic_alert_policy.alert.id
  channel_ids = [
    newrelic_alert_channel.email.id
  ]
}
```

## Support for v1.x

While the sun rises on the `2.x` release, the sunset of the `1.x` approaches.
We intend to support minor bug fixes through the end of 2020, but we don't plan
to merge any new features into `release/1.x` branch.  Please see the section
below about upgrading the provider.  All new feature work and focus will be
directed at the newer provider version.

-> <small>**Deprecation notice:** 2020-06-12<br>
-> **End of support:** 2020-01-15</small>

If you wish to pin your environment to a specific release, you can do so with a `required_providers` statement in your Terraform manifest. You can also pin the version within your `provider` block.

Using the `provider` block:

```hcl
provider "newrelic" {
  version = "~> 2.0.0"
}
```

Using the `required_providers` block:

```hcl
required_providers {
  newrelic = "~> 2.0.0"
}
```

See the [Terraform docs][provider_version_configuration] for more information on pinning versions.

## Upgrading to v2.x

Upgrading to v2 of the provider involves some changes to your provider configuration. Please view our [**migration guide**](guides/migration_guide_v2.html) for more information and assistance.

Please see the [latest provider configuration docs](guides/provider_configuration.html) for the current recommended configuration settings.


## Debugging

Additional debugging information can be generated by exporting the `TF_LOG` environment variable when running Terraform commands. See [Debugging Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/debugging.html) for more information.

### HTTP Request logging

Setting `TF_LOG` to a value of `DEBUG` will generate request log messages from the underlying HTTP client, and a value of `TRACE` will add additional context to these messages, including request and response body and headers.
