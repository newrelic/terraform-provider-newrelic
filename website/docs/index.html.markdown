# New Relic Provider

[New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) offers a performance management solution
enabling developers to diagnose and fix application performance problems in real time.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the New Relic provider
provider "newrelic" {
  api_key = var.newrelic_api_key
}

# Read an application resource
data "newrelic_application" "foo" {
  name = "foo"
}

# Create an alert policy
resource "newrelic_alert_policy" "alert" {
  name = "Alert"
}

# Add a condition
resource "newrelic_alert_condition" "foo" {
  policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.alert.id

  name        = "foo"
  type        = "apm_app_metric"
  entities    = [data.newrelic_application.foo.id]
  metric      = "apdex"
  runbook_url = "https://docs.example.com/my-runbook"

  term {
    duration      = 5
    operator      = "below"
    priority      = "critical"
    threshold     = "0.75"
    time_function = "all"
  }
}

# Add a notification channel
resource "newrelic_alert_channel" "email" {
  name = "email"
  type = "email"

  config {
    recipients              = "paul@example.com"
    include_json_attachment = "1"
  }
}

# Link the channel to the policy
resource "newrelic_alert_policy_channel" "alert_email" {
  policy_id  = newrelic_alert_policy.alert.id
  channel_id = newrelic_alert_channel.email.id
}
```

- `personal_api_key` - (Required only for the `newrelic_workload` resource) Your New Relic Personal API key. The `NEWRELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY` environment variable can also be used.
- `api_url` - (Optional) This argument changes the main REST API URL (default is https://api.newrelic.com/v2). If the New Relic account is in the EU, the API URL must be set to https://api.eu.newrelic.com/v2. The `NEWRELIC_API_URL` environment variable can also be used.
- `synthetics_api_url` - (Optional) This argument changes the Synthetics API URL (default is https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api). If the New Relic account is in the EU, the API URL must be set to https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api. The `NEWRELIC_SYNTHETICS_API_URL` environment variable can also be used.  This URL is used to provision Synthetics monitors and monitor scripts only.

If the New Relic account is in the EU, the Infra API URL must be set to https://infra-api.eu.newrelic.com/v2. The `NEWRELIC_INFRASTRUCTURE_API_URL` environment variable can also be used.  This URL is used to provision Infrastructure alert conditions only.
- `infra_api_url` - (Deprecated) This argument operates the same as `infrastructure_api_url` above, but is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the provider.
- `insecure_skip_verify` - (Optional) Trust self-signed SSL certificates. If omitted, the `NEWRELIC_API_SKIP_VERIFY` environment variable is used.

## Debugging

Additional debugging information can be generated by exporting the `TF_LOG` environment variable when running Terraform commands. See [Debugging Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/debugging.html) for more information.

### HTTP Request logging

Setting `TF_LOG` to a value of `DEBUG` will generate request log messages from the underlying HTTP client, and a value of `TRACE` will add additional context to these messages, including request and response body and headers.
