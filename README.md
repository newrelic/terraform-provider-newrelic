## Requirements

-   [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.11.x

## Using the provider

To use the latest version of the provider in your Terraform environment, run `terraform init` and Terraform will automatically install the provider.

If you wish to pin your environment to a specific release, you can do so with a `required_providers` statement in your Terraform manifest.

```hcl
required_providers {
    newrelic = "~> 1.19.0"
}
```

If you're developing and building the provider, follow the instructions to [install it as a plugin](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-a-plugin). After placing the provider your plugins directory, run `terraform init` to initialize it.

For more information on using the provider and the associated resources, please see the [provider documentation][provider_docs] page.

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your
machine (version 1.13+ is _required_). You'll also need to correctly setup a
[GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

Please see our [CONTRIBUTING][contributing] guide for more detail on the APIs
in use by this provider.

#### Building

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/newrelic/terraform-provider-newrelic`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/newrelic;
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/newrelic
$ git clone git@github.com:newrelic/terraform-provider-newrelic.git
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider. To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/newrelic/terraform-provider-newrelic
$ make build
```

#### Testing

In order to test the provider, run `make test`. This will run the unit test suite.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

_Note:_ Acceptance tests _create real resources_, and often cost money to run. The environment variables `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` and `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` must also be set with your associated keys for acceptance tests to work properly.

```sh
$ make testacc
```
